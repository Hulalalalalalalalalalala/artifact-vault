# Artifact Vault

Artifact Vault is a small Go command-line service for storing named files by content digest. It is the initial product baseline for a file and artifact storage system.

## Build and test

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/artifact-vault
```

## Usage

```bash
artifact-vault init --root ./vault
artifact-vault put --root ./vault --name releases/app.bin --file ./app.bin
artifact-vault list --root ./vault
artifact-vault get --root ./vault --name releases/app.bin --output ./restored.bin
artifact-vault verify --root ./vault
```

Objects are stored beneath `objects/` by SHA-256 digest. `index.json` maps logical names to immutable object metadata. Writes use temporary files followed by rename so interrupted writes do not expose partial objects or indexes.
